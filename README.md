# ControlRoom-for-Twitch

ControlRoom is a prototype for a production system for online channels based on Twitch.tv.
Written in AngularJs using Firebase API, the control room and the client are based on the master-slave architecture, in which one is fully dependant on the other one.
ControlRoom can change currently streamed channel and this change will be pushed to all clients.
